Django excercise - school website with database relations: 1-1, 1-many, many-many.
I have built the DynamicModelView - one view for all models. It dynamically can import data from a model and change it into a table in html.
Still I was advised by mentor to use Class Based Views in more simple way (CRUD view for each model, so x4 view for each model) as it is better resolution for future projects with more coplexicity.
